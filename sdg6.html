    </div>
     <p> New York City operates one of the most <a href="https://www.dec.ny.gov/docs/water_pdf/nycsystem.pdf"><em>complex water and wastewater systems</em></a> in the world. </p>

     <ul> <em>Did you know ?</em>
         <li>NYC collects water from 19 reservoirs and three controlled lakes</li>
         <li>NYC delivering more than one billion gallons of high-quality water everyday to its resident</li>
         <li>some of the water source are located 125 miles upstate.</li>

         <p> New York City is one of only fve large cities in the country that has a surface drinking water supply that does not require fltration as a form of treatment. 
        <p>although the water is still disinfected to reduce microbial risk. The City must also meet increasingly stringent regulations and requirements for simultaneous compliance</p> 
        <p> with the Clean Water Act (CWA) and SafeDrinking Water Act (SDWA) to protect the quality of our drinking water and aquatic resources,as well as to protect recreational opportunities in our waterways.</p></div>

     </div>
     <p> Local topography, dense urban development, the capacity of our aging sewer system and increasingly extreme weather are some of the biggest contributing factors for fooding. Some communities throughout New York City have been prone to fooding and drainage problems, including sections of Queens, Staten Island, the Bronx and Brooklyn.</p>
     <p>During wet weather events, runof from impervious surfaces of the City can cause fooding, convey pollutants to waterways through the Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System (MS4) and/or overwhelm the combined sewer system leading to combined sewer overfows (CSO).
     </p>
     <p>Stormwater runof is generated from rain and melting snow which is conveyed over impervious surfaces such as rooftops, streets, and sidewalks. Rather than being absorbed into the ground, water fows to catch basins in the streets, and from there into the sewers. These impervious surfaces cover approximately 72% of New York Cityâ€™s 305 square miles in land area and generate a signifcant amount of stormwater.
