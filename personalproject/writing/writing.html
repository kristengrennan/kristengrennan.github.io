  <h3>Goldroom Takes us to Paradise at Mysteryland USA</h3>
  <p>“Even when I was a kid and listening to music, it was really escapist for me so I was always drawn to warmer, tropical sounds. I always wanted to go somewhere–to paradise.”</p> <a href=http://sensiblereason.com/goldroom-takes-us-to-paradise-at-mysteryland-usa/ >Read More</a>

  <h3>Legendary Dubstep DJ Doctor P at Mysteryland</h3>
  <p>“The whole scene has moved into a more trappy direction but I just didn’t. Luckily I’m still here… Everything phases in and out over time: dubstep phased out and trap phased in, and I guess it’ll change. Dubstep still has its fan base, but it’s not like when it first came out–everyone was blow away by how crazy it was. But now, 5 or 6 years later, everyone is used to the sound of it so it’s not shocking anymore.” </p> <a href=http://sensiblereason.com/interview-legendary-dubstep-dj-doctor-p-at-mysteryland/ >Read More</a>
  
  <h3>Sander van Doorn on Gold Skies, Heldens, & Identity Radio</h3>
  <p>"As an artist you’re always working on progressing, reinventing yourself. I think sometimes you get caught up in that moment a little bit too much and you need to go back to where it all started and listen to how it all originated and you can get inspired by old tracks a lot. Going back through my old tracks, you realize, ‘Oh I know the soundbank I used. Let’s go back to the soundbank and see if we can use those sounds off the soundbank.’ I think this year has been the year of me going back to my roots for a lot of tracks. My label manager said to me recently, ‘You’re new assignment: go back to your old roots.’ I guess everyone was ready for me to go back to my old roots."</p> <a href=http://sensiblereason.com/sander-van-doorn-interview-gold-skies-oliver-heldens-identity-radio/ >Read More</a>

  <h3>Josh Wink: From Digital to Vinyl at Electric Zoo</h3>
  <p>"The thing is tattoos you can get removed, but music you can’t. Once it’s out there, it’s out there. You can have surgery and have your tattoo removed, but you can’t take records of music off the internet or off someone’s record shelf after they bought it. It’s nice to know that I did a whole cataloge of music from the 90s that people still dig and have memories to and it marks their time in their life of what they were doing. It’s like a smell. You have a smell and it brings to you back to something unique and special." </p><a href=http://sensiblereason.com/josh-wink-electric-zoo/ >Read More</a>

  <h3>Caravan Palace’s Hugues Payen</h3>
  <p>Electronic music is the real living music today, for it has penetrated almost every other style. As a living thing, it always evolves. In 2005, when we began, dubstep didn’t exist, even our own genre didn’t exist!! And at the same time, the economic environment has radicalized through the Internet and the digital way of consuming music.</p><a href=http://sensiblereason.com/interview-caravan-palace/ >Read More</a>

    <h3>Oliver Heldens: From High School to Main Stage at Mysteryland</h3>
  <p>“It was a huge surprise for me that it was so big. I really like “Gecko,” it was one of the best things I made at that moment. I didn’t think that so many other people would also like it and play it, share it. It’s a lot softer than all the hard house at the moment, it’s a lot different than the things that Tiesto makes, yet Tiesto released it on his label and so many big DJs supported it.”</p><a href=http://sensiblereason.com/oliver-heldens-high-school-main-stage-mysteryland-interview/ >Read More</a>
