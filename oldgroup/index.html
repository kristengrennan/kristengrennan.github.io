        <h3>What are the "Global Goals"?</h3>
        <div class=kgglobalgoalsquote>
            <p><strong>"The [Global Goals] offer a unique opportunity to put the whole world on a more prosperous and sustainable development path."</strong><br>Achim Steiner, United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Administrator (<a href="http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals.html">Source</a>)</p>

        <div class=kgglobalgoals>
            <div class=kgglobalgoalstext>
                <p>In 2015, world leaders came together to create the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), otherwise known as the Global Goals, were 17 goals built on the successes of the previous 8 Millennium Development Goals, while including new areas such as climate change, economic inequality, innovation, sustainable consumption, peace and justice, among other priorities. The goals are interconnected – often the key to success on one will involve tackling issues more commonly associated with another.</p>
                <p>The Global Goals provide clear guidelines and targets for all countries to adopt in accordance with their own priorities and the environmental challenges of the world at large. They tackle the root causes of poverty and unite the world together to make a positive change for both people and planet.</p>

                  <p>In April 2015, NYC committed to the principles of growth, equity, sustainability, and resiliency through its groundbreaking <a href="https://onenyc.cityofnewyork.us/">OneNYC</a> strategy, a model for sustainable development at the local level. OneNYC includes commitments, milestones, and metrics and publishes an annual progress report on Earth Day.</p>
                  <p>When global leaders committed to the Global Goals in September 2015, the NYC Mayor's Office recognized the overlap between OneNYC and the Global Goals, and used the Global Goals as a framework to discuss and share the City's best practices with partners in NYC and around the world. Diplomats and their staff are invited to visit the City's communities to see firsthand how NYC is implementing the Global Goals at the local level and to discuss shared challenges. New York City voices are also brought to the United Nations to infuse the local perspective into policy discussions about the implementation of the Global Goals.</p>

              <p>NYC announced on May 1, 2018, that it would become the first city in the world to submit a review of its progress directly to the United Nations. Modeled after the Voluntary National Review that countries are invited to submit every year, this report (known as a "Voluntary Local Review") highlights NYC's sustainable development achievements since 2015, using the Global Goals as a framework to translate NYC's local actions to a global audience, with a focus on the five priority goals:</p>
